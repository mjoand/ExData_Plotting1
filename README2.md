This assignment uses data from:
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. The Data Set was downloaded from the course web site:

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> 

The url is: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Note that the location of the data on the course web site may not be permanent, and, as such
in future runs of the code, it may be necessary to replace the url for the one corresponding to
the location of the data at the time.

The plots were executed under a Windows software, Windows 7 and R version 3.1.0
